	<h1>So you want to start a clothing company?</h1>



	<section>
		<h1>Your Website</h1>
		<p>For nearly every client of Renga that is selling a product online we strongly recommend using <a href="https://www.shopify.com/?ref=renga" target="_blank">Shopify</a>. We have lots of experience with Shopify as merchants, employees and partners. The tools that Shopify provides merchants are invaluable to running your business. You have the ability to manage inventory, orders, sales reporting, payment capture, shipping, point of sale, and the list goes on and on. Shopify has 24/7 phone, live chat and email support, that is beyond helpful.</p>

		<p>Many features that fall outside of the “out of the box” functionality on Shopify can often be solved by one of their third party apps from the <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Shopify App store</a>.</p>

		<p>I can’t recommend it enough. If you have any questions or comments, reach out to me.</p>


		<h2>Pick a Theme</h2>

		<p>Shopify has a catalogue of fully responsive themes ranging from $0-$180. There are many options and features that can be found in each theme. Shopify allows you to test the theme and customize it in your shop before you purchase. The only thing you can’t do is publish it as your live theme or access the code base. When looking for a new theme the main things to look at are the configuration options of the home page, the collection page, the product page and the blog. These are going to be your core areas of customization that will have varying options depending on the theme you pick.</p>

		<p>Shopify has a visual theme editor which allows you to see how your changes will look on the live website before you decide to save or publish anything. I would strongly recommend testing a few out and spend about 30 minutes trying out all the different home page modules and how they may be configured. Navigate in the live preview to a collection page and you will then see the customization options for the collection page on the left sidebar. You can do the same for the product pages.</p>

<h2>High Quality Assets</h2>
<p>When navigating the theme store you probably noticed that all of these themes looked amazing, the main reason is because they have high quality images that all work together. You can make the Debut theme that Shopify provides look fantastic with high quality images that are all properly sized with a clear brand identity.
The quickest way to make a Shopify site look clean is to ensure that every type of photo is the same aspect ratio. Meaning all product photos are a 1:1 aspect ratio (square). Ensuring that all slideshow images are of the same ratio (eg. 3:2 or 2:1). Without doing this, your grid will feel much more sloppy. Your slideshow will feel jumpy as the content below jumps up and down as the slides change.</p>

		<h1>Making a Sale</h1>

		<p>This is where it’s tough for me to give any advice because I believe that outside of the large bucket general advice, it needs to be customized to your brand.
		The large bucket ideas that will work in 2019 for a clothing company are:</p><br/>
		<li>Instagram (Paid & Organic)</li>
		<li>Influencer Marketing</li>
	</ul><br/>
		<p>I will give this advice to nearly all clothing companies, but so will Google. You need to make content and marketing strategy that is surrounding the whitespaces of your brand. This means if your brand is targeting gamers, perhaps you run game reviews or product reviews on PC’s, mouse, keyboard, etc. Providing value to your market that allows them to engage with your brand without it feeling like a commercial.</p>

		<h1>After the Sale<h1>

		<h2>Shipping</h2>
		<p>Shipping has gotten more expensive. A lot of new clothing companies start to put themselves into trouble by offering free shipping without understanding the cost of shipping. For example at the time of this article I put a one pound package 5 in x 3 in x 1 in shipping from Toronto to Vancouver. The cheapest rate that I am given is $16.66.
		If you are trying to sell a t-shirt for $20 and it cost you $10 and now you are going to offer free shipping. You’ve spent $26.66 for $20 of revenue and that’s not factoring in the cost of the packaging and any stickers you might want to throw in the package.
		Shopify has a feature called real-time carrier calculated shipping. In the checkout the customer will enter their shipping address, in the backend Shopify knows your ship from address and the product weights. It will do a live calculation of the rate from the services that you connect. You can even add a margin on top of the calculated rates to make sure you can cover the cost of the packaging.
		Shipping can quickly break a business model. I’ve experienced this myself when I started a subscription coffee service. The premise was that you get a pound of coffee delivered to your door at whatever frequency you determined. It started to break because I didn’t have the volume to negotiate better rates with a carrier and there isn’t enough margin in a single bag of coffee to offer free shipping. I could service local subscriptions by hoping in my car and putting them on the doorstep myself, but that isn’t very scalable. This means you need to either increase your margin by reducing cost or increasing your price. Many businesses will split shipping with the customer. If shipping is generally 10, they’ll put a $5 shipping charge on the item and then sacrifice $5 of margin (If they can afford to do it).</p>

		<h2>Packaging</h2>
		<p>Many ecommerce businesses that win big create an experience that feels special when it arrives at your door. My favourite example of this is moo.com. Whenever I get a moo package it’s exciting, their expensive business cards and I’m always happy to open it, because the packaging is sharp and on brand, sometimes there are little samples of new products they have. Simply it’s a continuation of their brand experience. The interaction with your brand doesn’t end at the checkout screen. It continues through right until the product gets in their hands. We just talked about the thin margins caused by shipping rates, but I would strongly recommend using any bonus margin to create a “surprise & delight” customer experience.</p>

		<h2>Newsletter</h2>
		<p>After you have gotten the sale, it’s important to maintain relationships with your customers. A great way to do this is email, Shopify has a built-in Mailchimp integrations where customers are automatically added to your Mailchimp list. This is a great way to announce new product launches, sales, etc. You would be surprised how well email converts to sales in 2019. Build your mailing list!</p>
